abstract: Transdiagnostic models of psychopathology suggest that disorders may
  share common features that could influence their severity. Attention problems
  and psychomotor restlessness are included in the diagnostic criteria for
  several disorders, including disorders on the internalizing spectrum, but
  their transdiagnostic significance has received little attention. We
  identified patterns of attention problems and restlessness among
  clinic-referred youth (N = 142; age 11-18) with internalizing problems, in
  order to understand their clinical significance in terms of internalizing
  symptom severity and response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). A latent
  class analysis was used to identify patterns of self-reported attention
  problems and psychomotor restlessness, and classes were compared on
  internalizing, depression, and anxiety severity. Differences in treatment
  response were examined in a subset of youth (n = 82; age 14–18) who
  participated in group CBT. Youth in the Attention Problems class (42% of
  sample) and youth in the Restless class (15% of sample) endorsed significantly
  more internalizing, depression, and anxiety problems than youth with Low
  Symptoms of attention problems or psychomotor restlessness (43% of sample).
  Youth in the Restless class responded significantly better to CBT than youth
  in the Low Symptoms of attention problems or psychomotor restlessness class in
  terms of decrease in overall internalizing problems. Attention problems and
  psychomotor restlessness appear to be important transdiagnostic markers of
  severity across the internalizing spectrum; however, they do not limit the
  effectiveness of CBT and, in the case of psychomotor restlessness, may
  forecast a good treatment response.
